Remember those walls I built
Well, baby, they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound

Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
